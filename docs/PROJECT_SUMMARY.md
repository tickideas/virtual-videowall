# Virtual Video Wall - Project Summary

## 🎯 Project Overview

A complete virtual video wall platform designed for connecting 50-60 churches during monthly zonal meetings, optimized for low-bandwidth environments (300-500 Kbps per church).

## ✅ What's Been Built

### 🏗️ Core Architecture
- **Framework**: Next.js 15 with App Router and TypeScript
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM

### 🎨 User Interfaces

#### 1. Church Interface (`/church`)
- Simple 6-digit code entry for session and church
- Camera preview before going live
- Optimized video settings (240x180 @ 8fps)
- Connection quality indicator
- Muted audio by default
- Mobile responsive

#### 2. Video Wall Display (`/wall`)
- Paginated grid view (4x5 = 20 churches per page)
- Next/Previous navigation between pages
- Fullscreen mode
- Real-time connection status
- Church name overlays
- Optimized for 6-8 Mbps connection

#### 3. Admin Portal (`/admin`)
