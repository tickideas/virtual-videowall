## 🎯 Daily.co - FREE TIER WINNER! 🎉

### Daily.co Pricing

**Free Tier:**
- ✅ **10,000 participant minutes/month** - FREE!
- ✅ **Perfect for your use case!**

### Your Usage Calculation

| Sessions/Month | Churches | Duration | Participant Minutes | Cost |
|----------------|----------|----------|-------------------|------|
| 1 | 50 | 2 hours | 50 × 120 = 6,000 | **FREE** ✅ |
| 1 | 60 | 2.5 hours | 60 × 150 = 9,000 | **FREE** ✅ |
| 2 | 50 | 2 hours | 2 × 6,000 = 12,000 | $20 (2k over) |
| 1 | 60 | 3 hours | 60 × 180 = 10,800 | **FREE** ✅ |

**Analysis:**
- ✅ **1 session/month** with 50-60 churches for 2-3 hours: **COMPLETELY FREE!**
- ✅ Even at 10,000 minutes exactly, you can do:
  - 55 churches × 180 minutes (3 hours) = 9,900 minutes ✅
  - 60 churches × 166 minutes (2.75 hours) = 9,960 minutes ✅

**Paid Tier (if you exceed free):**
- $0.01 per participant minute after 10,000
- Still cheaper than LiveKit Cloud's $0.007... wait, no - Daily is actually **more expensive** per minute
- But with 10,000 FREE minutes, you likely won't need paid tier!
